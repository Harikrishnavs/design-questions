# Design Snakes and Ladders

## What is Snakes and Ladders?

Snakes and ladders is an ancient Indian board game that's regarded today as a worldwide classic. It requires two or more players and takes place on a board with numbered, gridded squares. Throughout the board, there are snakes and ladders which connect different squares. Players roll a die and navigate the board. Landing on a ladder advances a player to a square further up the board, while landing on a snake means they have to go back to a previous square.

The aim of the game is to reach the final square.

## Expectations
* The code should be working and functionally correct
* Good software design practices should be followed:
* Code should be modular, readable, extensible
* Separation of concern should be addressed
* Project structured well across multiple files/ packages
* Write unit tests
* No need of GUI


## Requirements gathering

What are some questions you would ask to gather requirements?
```
```

## Requirements
What will be 10 requirements of the system, according to you?
Do not worry about the correctness of the requirements, just write down whatever comes to your mind.
Your job is not to generate the requirements, but get better at understanding problem statements and anticipating the functionalities your application might need.

* A game can be between multiple players.
* A game will only have human players
* Each player can have multiple pieces
* A board can be of any varying size decided by the client
* A board will different types of cells
* There can be a normal cell and cells with snakes and ladders
* Position of snakes and ladders is random and decided at the start of the game
* The number of snakes and ladders is random and also decided at the start of the game
* The size of snakes and ladders is also random and decided at the start of the game
* A player will move on the basis of a dice
* A player will enter the game only if they get a 1 or maximum face value of the dice
* A player will win if they reach the last cell
* The game will end when all players expect one reach the last cell
* For each game maintain a leaderboard which has the rankings of each player

## Use case diagrams

Are the requirements clear enough to define use cases?
If not, try to think of the actors and their interactions with the system.

### Actors
What would be the actors in this system?
```
```

### Use cases

What would be the use cases i.e. the interactions between the actors and the system?

#### Actor 1

Name of the actor - ` `

Use cases:
```
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
```
#### Actor 2

Name of the actor - ` `
Use cases:
```
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
```

#### Actor 3

Name of the actor - ` `
Use cases:
```
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
```
Add more actors and their use cases as needed.

**Create a use case diagram for the system.**

```

## Class diagram

What will be the major classes and their attributes?

```
    Class name
        - Attribute 1
        - Attribute 2
        ...
```

List down the cardinalities of the relationships between the classes.
```
```

Draw the class diagram.
